First attempt at pushing form information into objects in JS
-This one was a mission. Scrapped the original idea that used innerHTML.
-Got stuck not realizing classList.add creates a new class doesnt append element to existing class like .className.
-Made a table in the original but it looked quite ugly. Need to practice more with data.
-Finally got a grasp on how <form> works. Stil need practice on it though.
<!-- -Having trouble figuring out how to use the 'X' button on the created element to close that specific element. -->
-Figured out I needed to use e.target.parentNode.parentNode and not just e (.target is important)
